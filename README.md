## Introduction

Scanning refers to the process of discovering, analyzing, and reporting on security flaws and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans are conducted via automated tools to identify potential risk exposures and attack vectors across systems.

In this case, the target is `192.168.1.98`.

### NMAP SCAN

I used Nmap, a network scanning tool, to scan the target system and identified that it runs on a Windows 7 Operating System with port `445` (Microsoft-ds) open.

### Vulnerability Exploitation

I discovered a vulnerability associated with the Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP) version, known as `MS17-010 EternalBlue SMB Remote Windows Kernel Pool Corruption`. Exploiting this vulnerability allowed unauthorized access to the system. I utilized the Metasploit framework to exploit the vulnerability and gain access.
